# Solar Flare Prediction Project

The goal of this project is to use data mining techniques to predict solar flares, which are powerful eruptions of energy from the sun that can have significant impacts on Earth and human technology. The project will use the UCI Solar Flare Dataset, which contains a variety of information about solar flares that have occurred in the past, including the time, location, and intensity of the flare, as well as various characteristics of the sun's surface.

The data mining techniques that will be used in this project may include classification algorithms (such as logistic regression or decision trees) to predict whether a given set of solar activity will result in a flare. Additionally, clustering and association rule mining techniques may be used to identify patterns and relationships within the data that can help to improve the accuracy of the flare predictions.

The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict solar flares, which can be used to help protect satellites and other technology from damage, as well as to aid in the study of the sun's behavior.

## Getting Started

1. Download the UCI Solar Flare dataset from the link provided.
2. Run the data cleaning process to get the dataset ready for data mining.
3. Visualize the data to find relationships
4. Apply different data mining techniques to the dataset to develop a model that can predict solar flares.
5. Interpret the results and conclusion.

## File Descriptions
* `SolarFlare.csv` : The original dataset from UCI.
* `SolarFlare_Clean.csv` : The cleaned version of the dataset.
* `SolarFlare_Analysis.ipynb` : Jupyter notebook containing the data cleaning, data mining and model evaluation process.

## Results
The results of this project will be presented in the form of visualizations and performance metrics.

## Conclusion
The conclusion will summarize the findings of the project and discuss the potential implications of the results.
